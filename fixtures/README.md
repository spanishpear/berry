The fixtures here are borrowed from:
 - [Turborepo lockfile parser](https://github.com/vercel/turborepo/tree/main/crates/turborepo-lockfiles/fixtures)
 - [Nx lockfile parser](https://github.com/nrwl/nx/tree/master/packages/nx/src/plugins/js/lock-file/__fixtures__)


 They are both appropriately MIT licensed, and have been taken purely for testing purposes :)

 - [turborepo-LICENSE](https://github.com/vercel/turborepo/blob/main/LICENSE)

 Implementations have been developed independantly - because I wanted to learn nom :D
